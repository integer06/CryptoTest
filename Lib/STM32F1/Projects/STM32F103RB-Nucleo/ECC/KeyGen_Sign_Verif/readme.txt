@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library ECC algorithm 
in example of an ECC key generation and signature verification with Parameters 
for Elliptic Curve: P-192, P-256 and P-384.

ECC starts by initilizing the Elliptic Curve parameters and generating the ECC 
key pair using RNG algorithm. When Public Key is validated, signature object 
will be initialized and prepare the structure for the ECDSA signature 
verification based on SHA-256.

ECC functions can return ECC_SUCCESS in case of successful ECC operation or one
of the following error codes in case of fail:
  - HASH_ERR_BAD_OPERATION,
  - HASH_ERR_BAD_CONTEXT,
  - HASH_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER,
  - ERR_MEMORY_FAIL, 
  - ECC_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER,
  - ECC_ERR_BAD_CONTEXT,
  - ECC_ERR_MISSING_EC_PARAMETE,
  - MATH_ERR_BIGNUM_OVERFLOW,
  - MATH_ERR_INTERNAL,
  - RNG_ERR_INTERNAL,
  - RNG_ERR_UNINIT_STATE 
  - SIGNATURE_INVALID.
  
The green LED will be toggled three times each 500 milliseconds before starting 
the ECC algorithms operations.    
In case of successful operations the green led will be turned on and in case of 
fail it will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.   
  
User application needs to check on returned value to determine which action will
be run in both fail and success cases.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F103RB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F103RB-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
