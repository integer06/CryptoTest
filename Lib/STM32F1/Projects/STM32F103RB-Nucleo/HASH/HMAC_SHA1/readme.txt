@par Example Description
This example describes how to use the STM32 Cryptographic Library SHA1 Hash  
algorithm to generate message digest.

The SHA1 Hash algorithm is used to generate 20 bytes (CRL_SHA1_SIZE) HMAC digest 
of input message.

SHA1 hash routines can return HASH_SUCCESS in case of successful hash operation
or one of the following error codes in case of fail: 
  - HASH_ERR_BAD_PARAMETER,
  - HASH_ERR_BAD_CONTEXT, 
  - HASH_ERR_BAD_OPERATION.

A comparison between the generated digest data and expected digest data is done 
to check that the input data have been correctly hashed.

The green LED will be toggled three times each 500 milliseconds before starting 
the SHA1 algorithms operations.    
In case of successful hash operations the green led will be turned on and 
in case of fail it will be toggled each 250 milliseconds in an infinity loop.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F103RB devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F103RB-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
